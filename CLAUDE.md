# decomp — orientation for Claude

This repo is a **multi-project N64 decompilation agent**. It wraps splat / asm-differ / m2c / IDO / GCC-KMC and layers a Claude-driven workflow on top. Per-project work happens under `projects/<name>/`; the top-level code is cross-project infrastructure.

## Layout

- `main.py`, `decomp/` — Python CLI. Subcommands: `discover`, `info`, `m2c`, `diff`, `agent`, `export-episodes`, `log-exact-episode`. Invoke with `uv run python -m decomp.main <cmd>`.
- `projects/<game>/` — one decomp project per ROM. Has its own splat config, Makefile, `asm/`, `src/`, `episodes/`, `baserom.z64`.
- `projects/<game>-agent-<letter>/` — git worktrees for parallel Claude agents. Each on branch `agent-<letter>`. Never commit on `main` while an agent branch is active.
- `tools/` — downloaded third-party binaries (IDO, asm-processor, permuter, KMC GCC).
- `references/` — local clones of `libreultra`, `oot`, `papermario`. Grepped by `scripts/decomp-search` when matching libultra helpers.
- `scripts/decomp-search` — grep the reference clones. First thing to run when you recognize a `__os*` / `__rmon*` / libgcc helper.
- `scripts/land-successful-decomp.sh` — per-project landing script. Rebases the agent branch onto `origin/main`, refuses to land unless `report.json` shows the function as exact + `episodes/<func>.json` exists, then fast-forwards main and pushes.
- `.claude/commands/` — skills. The main one is `/decompile` (daily driver). Siblings: `/merge-fragments`, `/split-fragments` (via script), `/setup-objdiff`, `/refine-splat`, `/new-project`, `/decompile-f3dex2`.
- `TRAINING_PLAN.md` — active design doc on how exact-match episodes feed into SFT / verifier-RL. Not a completed spec.

## Workflow entry points

- **Decompile one function:** invoke the `/decompile` skill (or run `/loop /decompile` to iterate). The skill handles project discovery, worktree selection, asm reading, matching, episode logging, and landing.
- **Add a new game:** `/new-project` skill.
- **Debug a stuck diff:** `objdiff-cli diff -u <unit> <func>` for mnemonic-level comparison; falls back to `objdump -M no-aliases` for exact-byte verification.
- **Research a technique:** the user's auto-memory at `~/.claude/projects/-home-dan-Documents-code-decomp/memory/` has ~100 feedback memos on IDO/GCC matching gotchas. `MEMORY.md` is the always-loaded index.

## Key conventions

- **Episodes are for exact matches only.** NON_MATCHING wraps don't get episodes — they'd train on wrong bytes.
- **NM wraps preserve the C, not `INCLUDE_ASM`.** Template: `#ifdef NON_MATCHING { body } #else INCLUDE_ASM(...); #endif`. Threshold ≥80 % match; below that keep plain INCLUDE_ASM.
- **Commit per-function, don't batch.** One match → one commit with its episode → land via script → push.
- **`report.json` is git-tracked but updated by the land script.** Before landing, `git checkout HEAD -- report.json` if your worktree has stomped it during local diffing.
- **asm-processor (IDO) / KMC GCC (Glover)** — per-project compiler. See each project's notes in the `/decompile` skill.

## Not in this repo

- No pre-built compilers committed — `tools/ido-static-recomp/` and `tools/gcc_2.7.2/` are built or downloaded per machine.
- No ROMs committed — `baserom.z64` files live in each project but are gitignored.
